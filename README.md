## SAOA - Smart AI Outreach Automation

To build the project run:

```bash
yarn build
```

It will generate a `out/` directory with all the files needed to run the extension in the browser.

Upload the `out/` directory to the browser extensions (`chrome://extensions/`) in developer mode.

Go to browser > extensions > SAOA to see the result.

After you made some changes, run `yarn build` again and reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`.
